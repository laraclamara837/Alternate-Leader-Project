The Ottoman Empire was born in Bithynia, starting as a small country in Eastern Anatolia in 12th century, then expanded to west into Anatolia. Over the next century, your people vanquished the empire of Byzantium, annexing Turkey and the Balkans, and smartly assimilating all wonders and knowledge of the Byzantine civilization. In the mid 15th century, the Ottomans added Constantinople to their empire, establishing a strategic link between Europe and the Middle East. The Empire would continue to expand for centuries reaching North Africa, Middle East and Eastern Europe at its height, but brutally disappeared in the chaos of the first world war, in early 20th century.",

Appointed as joint ruler with your younger brother, you were faced with many difficult situations early in your reign, with the nation in turmoil, famine in abundance and floods in deficit. Eager to rule alone, you acted on these problems yourself, leading your brother to depose you despite your efforts. As Rome’s shadow fell across the Mediterranean, you led the once mighty kingdom of the Ptolemaic dynasty during a time of turmoil. An excellent diplomat, you secured the favour of the Romans and thus, ensured the survival of Egypt as an independent nation and your return to life as the soul monarch. Challenges to your throne were seen off time and time again by your legendary wisdom, striking deals to ensure your survival while the world around descended into civil war.
